# Prediction and detection of epileptic seizures

The goal of this study is to predict and detect seizures by analyzing data acquired from electroencephalograms (EEGs). To achieve this, I focused on identifying patterns within the three classes: Interictal, Pre-Ictal, and Ictal. 

I used both shallow and deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks, utilizing vectors with 29 features.
